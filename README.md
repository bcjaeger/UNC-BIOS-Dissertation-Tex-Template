# UNC-BIOS-Dissertation-Tex-Template
This collection of LaTex files can be used as a template for UNC BIOS students writing a doctoral thesis. 

## Using The Files

* The main file (UNC_Dissertation.Rnw) compiles in the KnitR environment and produces several supplementary files. If you prefer not to work in the KnitR environment, one of the generated supplementary files (UNC_Dissertation.tex) can be used. 

* The "frontmatter" and "common" folders contain several .tex files that can be filled in with your own details. The only file you will need to supply is your .bib library.
